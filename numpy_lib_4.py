#Reshaping arrays
#Two common numpy functions used in deep learning are np.shape and np.reshape().
# X.shape is used to get the shape (dimension) of a matrix/vector X.
# X.reshape(...) is used to reshape X into some other dimension.

#Exercise: Implement the function image2vector() that takes an input of shape (length, height, 3) and returns a vector of shape (length*height*3, 1). For example, if you would like to reshape an array v of shape (a, b, c) into a vector of shape (a*b,c) you would do:
#image2vector

    


import numpy as np
import math

def image2vector(image):
    """
    Argument:
    image -- a numpy array of shape (length, height, depth)
    
    Returns:
    v -- a vector of shape (length*height*depth, 1)
    """

    """

    3D array of shape (length, height, depth = 3)
    algorithm you convert it to a vector of shape (length * height * 3, 1)
    reshape, the 3D array into a 1D vector
